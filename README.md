Anvil is a mineraft plugin api that aims to help developers create structured cross-platform plugins.
Included is an entity framework and many services that abstract platform-specific actions so that they can be used in common code.

Anvil is not only cross-platform in the context of plugin platforms, but also in the context of databases.
Currently, MongoDB and Xodus are supported, with SQL on the way.
With Anvil, you can write a central abstract set of logic that applies to several database types.

## Quick start

```groovy
repositories {
   mavenCentral();
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.anvilpowered:anvil-api:0.1'
}
```
