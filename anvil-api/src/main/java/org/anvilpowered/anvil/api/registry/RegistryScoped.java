/**
 * Used to indicate the persistence of a value or validity of a method in relation to reloads.
 * <p>
 * A field annotated with {@code RegistryScoped} must be persisted (cached) only between reloads
 * of that scope. For example, you may choose to persist a result calculated from a configurable
 * value (see {@link Registry}). This is illustrated here:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * public class FooService {
 *
 *     // this instance is persisted only for the duration of the scope
 *    {@literal @}RegistryScoped
 *     private Foo foo;
 *
 *     // used to calculate foo
 *     private final Registry registry;
 *
 *    {@literal @}Inject
 *     public FooService(Registry registry) {
 *         this.registry = registry;
 *         registry.whenLoaded(this::loaded).register();
 *     }
 *
 *     public void loaded() {
 *         // invalidate foo
 *         foo = null;
 *     }
 *
 *     // instances returned here are persisted only for the duration of the scope
 *    {@literal @}RegistryScoped
 *     public Foo getFoo() {
 *         if (foo == null) {
 *             foo = ...; // use registry for lazy initialization of foo
 *         }
 *         return foo;
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * A method annotated with {@code RegistryScoped} must be invoked inside of a reloaded listener
 * of the same scope. An example of this is {@link Registry#set(Key, Object)}. Although it has a
 * void return type, the side effects of this method will only persist during a scope and so must
 * be invoked again to maintain these side effects.
 * </p>
