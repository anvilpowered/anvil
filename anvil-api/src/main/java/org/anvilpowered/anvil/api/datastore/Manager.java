/**
 * <p>
 * A module consists of a {@link Manager} and a (single) {@link Component}
 * for every data storage implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link Manager} of a module is its metaphorical gateway. Interactions with
 * other modules should (almost always) be done through the {@link Manager}.
 * There are, however, some cases where direct access to a component is required.
 * One such case is inter-{@link Repository} access that requires compile time
 * type safety. Because the {@link Component#getTKeyClass()} type is not known
 * to the manager, code that interacts with {@code TKey} must be placed in a
 * {@link Component}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One of the primary functions of a {@link Manager} is to provide the correct
 * {@link Component} implementation via {@link #getPrimaryComponent()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of {@link Manager} should consist of methods similar to the
 * following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code CompletableFuture<TString> create(UUID userUUID);}</li>
 *     <li>{@code CompletableFuture<TString> invite(UUID userUUID, UUID targetUserUUID);}</li>
 *     <li>{@code CompletableFuture<TString> kick(UUID userUUID, UUID targetUserUUID);}</li>
 *     <li>{@code CompletableFuture<List<TString>> list(String query);}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@code TString} is the base return type for the methods in a {@link Manager}.
 * To build these results use {@link TextService.Builder}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All methods (with some exceptions) in {@link Manager} should return a form of {@code TString}
 * to be displayed directly to the end user. Normally, the return type, {@code TString}, is wrapped in
 * a {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture} in order to keep the main game thread
 * free from IO. It is sometimes necessary to further wrap the {@code TString} in a {@link java.util.List}
 * when the result is more than a single line. In this case, pagination can be used to display the result
 * to the end user.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following interface signature is an example of a simple {@link Manager}:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public interface FooManager<
 * TFoo extends Foo<?>,
 * TString>
 * extends Manager<FooRepository<?, TFoo, ?, ?>>
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <C> Base {@link Component} type for this manager.
 *            Must be implemented by all components in this module
 * @see Repository
 * @see Component
 * @see TextService
